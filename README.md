### Objectives:
- Building a single page application (SPA) with React
- Managing routes with React Router
- Using React Hooks
- Functional programming
- Test driven development with React Testing Library and Jest
- Meeting model client requirements

## Features
Math Magicians is a single page application with three routes located in the navigation bar: `Home`, `Calculator`, and `Quote`. The `Home` page welcomes users and provides a quick overview of the purpose and architecture of the web app. The `Calculator` page provides
some instructions alongside a fully functional calculator that performs arithmetic operations. The following operations are supported: `addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, negation, decimals`. For evaluations longer than 12 values, the calculator returns an exponential form. The operation carried out is displayed in the top left corner of the calculator display.

The `Quote` page shows random quotes in a section called `Quote of the day`. All quotes are from notable mathematicians and scientists,
and they are referenced below each quote.
